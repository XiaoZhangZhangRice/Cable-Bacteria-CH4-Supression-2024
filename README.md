A field study was conducted in 2024 at the Rice Experiment Station.

The following treatments were tested:

C: Control 
CSMD: Cable bacteria sulfate, dry microbial innoculant 
SM: Cable bacteria, sulfate, wet microbial innoculant 
CS: Sulfate only
SMW: Sulfate, worms, cable bacteria, wet microbial innoculant 

Yield was an estimation. Plots were harvested from gas rings and dried. 50% of the dry biomass was assumed to be grain. Grain biomass was then scaled to 14% moisture and Mg/ha for reporting.

Here are the raw methane data and scripts for analysis, including repeated measures from the same plots.
